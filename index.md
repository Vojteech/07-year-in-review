# Year in Review

May 2024

It is pretty hard to summarize the last 365 days because I feel like not much has happened but at the same time probably a lot of things has happened.

I feel like my last 12 months were mainly about finishing school. I was trying to enjoy my last semesters, to enjoy life as much as I could, to not think about future. But at the same time I had to think about future which is usually a pretty stressful time for me. 
I feel like I´ve made a lot of decisions and in the next 12 months I´m going to be finding out if those dicisions were right.
